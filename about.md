## Past projects

### mc-ping

[mc-ping](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mc-ping) is a project I created to be able to use the server-list-ping feature of Minecraft from within node.js. Unfortunately it no longer works correctly with Minecraft 1.8+, but it has been forked and superseded by [mc-ping-updated](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mc-ping-updated), by CryptKeeper.
