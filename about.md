Hey, I'm David White, a software developer living near Stoke-on-Trent primarily using Erlang.
I'm proficient in Erlang, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Ruby and PHP.

I have an HND in Computer Games Programming from [Staffordshire University](https://www.staffs.ac.uk),
and still have a passion for games programming and related disciplines (Running/automating game servers, for example).

You can find me on GitHub:

## Past projects

### mc-ping

[mc-ping](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mc-ping) is a project I created to be able to use the server-list-ping feature of Minecraft from within node.js.
Unfortunately it no longer works correctly with Minecraft 1.8+. A working fork ([mc-ping-updated](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mc-ping-updated)) has been created by CryptKeeper.

You can find the source code for mc-ping at {% include icon-github.html username="wizardfrag" %} / [mc-ping](https://github.com/wizardfrag/mc-ping)
